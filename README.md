# Chicopee Pitch
I've got partners!

Modelling the card game [Pitch](https://www.pagat.com/allfours/pitch.html) ([aka High-Low-Jack, Setback](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Chicopee%20Pitch)) in Javascript.

The purpose of this project is to learn some new ES6 goodies, especially classes and Array.Prototypes.

Who knew unicode had a full 58-card deck of icons? 🂠🂡🂨🃘🃑
